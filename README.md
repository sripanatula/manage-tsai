## Kailash ‚Äì An AI-Driven Timesheet Management

### üåü Purpose

To demonstrate a working Proof of Concept (PoC) for a system that:

1. Reviews and analyzes timesheets (CSV/Excel)
2. Identifies anomalies using sample rules
3. Reaches out to the user to correct issues using methods including Email and SMS

This PoC is intentionally scoped to **manual triggers**, **hardcoded rules**, and **a single alert channel**. However, it lays the groundwork for an enterprise-scale, prompt, and self-learning solution intended to serve the needs of large, multi-national organizations.

### üõ†Ô∏è Designed for Future Growth

This PoC **does not implement** AI/agentic capabilities, but it is structured to allow for:

* Plug-and-play alert channels
* Rule expansion
* Message personalization
* Intelligent follow-up

These can be layered on post-PoC as part of the broader **Realtime Event Notification Platform**.
