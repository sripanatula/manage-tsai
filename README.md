# manage-tsai

A PoC for managing consulting operations, focused on validating timesheets using rule-based checks and delivering contextual notifications via email, SMS, voice, and WhatsApp â€” with future support for Agentic AIâ€“driven follow-ups.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Purpose

This project demonstrates a working Proof of Concept (PoC) for automating timesheet validation and alerting in a consulting business context. It is designed to reduce manual effort and improve compliance by integrating intelligent rule-checking and multi-channel notifications.

## âœ… In-Scope Features (PoC Phase)

| Area              | Details                                                                                     |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Input**     | Manual upload via CLI (CSV/XLSX timesheets)                                                |
| **Validation Rules** | - More than 8 hours/day<br>- Weekend or holiday work<br>- Missing weekday entries       |
| **Notifications**   | Email and mock SMS based on user preferences<br>Console output for observability          |
| **Configuration**   | `.env.dev` for credentials and routing<br>Employee directory supports multi-channel prefs |
| **Logging**         | Alerts and violations saved to JSON (SQLite planned)                                      |

## ðŸ”’ Not Included in This PoC

* Web-based upload or dashboards (coming next)
* Real-time ingestion (e.g., via API, DB)
* Retry/escalation logic
* Agentic AI reasoning (planned)
* Authentication, authorization, user roles

## ðŸ”„ Designed for Growth

This PoC is structured for easy extension:

- Plug-and-play notification channels (email, SMS, voice, WhatsApp)
- Future UI for file uploads, rule inspection, and compliance reporting
- Agentic AI reasoning for choosing the best channel/timing
- Secure config via cloud secret managers

---

## ðŸ§  Architecture Direction

- **RENO (Realtime Event Notification Orchestrator)**: A future module that will handle adaptive, rule- and context-aware delivery strategies.
- **Agentic Follow-up**: Notification behavior will eventually adapt based on past user response history and alert severity.

## ðŸš€ Run Locally

```bash
# Setup
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add your .env.dev with email credentials
cp .env.sample .env.dev

# Run the PoC
python main.py data/sample_timesheet.csv
